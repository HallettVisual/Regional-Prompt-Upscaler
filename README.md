# **Regional Prompt Upscaler**

**Version:** 1.2  
**Author:** [Hallett Visual](https://hallett-ai.com)

The **Regional Prompt Upscaler** is a powerful extension for **Automatic1111 Web UI** and **Forge**. It takes your upscaling workflow to the next level by splitting images into tiles and applying region-specific prompts generated with advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Whether you're working on artistic renders, architectural imagery, or complex visual projects, this tool delivers unmatched precision and control.

## **Features**

- **Four Prompt Generation Methods**:
  Generate region-specific prompts using BLIP, Florence-2, CLIP, or ViT-GPT2 for detailed image detection.
  
- **Auto Tile Scaling**:
  Automatically adjusts tile size based on the dimensions of your image for efficient processing and optimal results.
  
- **Regional Prompt Export to Excel**:
  Export tile prompts to an Excel file for batch editing and re-import them to streamline your workflow.  
  Example of an exported Excel file:

- **Simple or Complex Prompt Options**:
  Choose between concise or detailed prompts depending on your project's requirements.

- **Enhanced Feathering and Overlap**:
  Adjust feathering and overlap percentages for smooth blending of tiles without visible edges or seams.

- **Quick LoRA Selection**:
  Easily apply LoRA models via a convenient dropdown menu. LoRA settings are automatically injected into the prompt.

- **Unlimited Upscaling**:
  Go beyond the default 4X limit in WebUI by combining multi-generation upscaling with prompt control, enabling any resolution.

- **Works Seamlessly with Flux, Stable Diffusion (SD), and SDXL**:
  Fully compatible with modern models, allowing flexibility across different pipelines.

### **2. Set Scaling and Denoising Strength**
- Use the "Resize by" option (e.g., 4X) to specify the upscale factor.
- Adjust the **denoising strength** based on your project:
  - **0.3â€“0.5 for visible changes** (recommended: **0.38** for balance).

### **3. Configure Tile and Prompt Settings**
- **Tile Size**: Adjust based on your image dimensions (default: **1024**).
- **Feather Amount**: Set feathering (e.g., **50**) for smoother blending.
- **Overlap Percentage**: Choose overlap for seamless tile transitions (e.g., **20%**).
- **Prompt Generation Method**: Select from BLIP, Florence-2, CLIP, or ViT-GPT2 for accurate prompt creation.
- **LoRA Selection**: Add LoRA models for additional control. The selection updates the prefix automatically.
